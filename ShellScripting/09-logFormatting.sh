#We have a few different applications running on this system. The list of applications are stored at /tmp/assets/apps.txt file. Each application has it's logs stored in /var/log/apps directory under a file with its name. Check it out!

#Write a shell script that inspects the log file of the applications and prints the number of GET, POST, and DELETE requests. Update the script to use a for loop to read the list of applications from the apps.txt file and count number of requests for each application and display it in a tabular format like this.

#Log name GET POST DELETE
#- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
#Finance 10 20 50
#Marketing 20 10 30
